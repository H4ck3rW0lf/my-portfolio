    <p class="mt-4">
      I am currently learning programming and do not have much experience yet, but I am excited to start an internship soon.<br>
      I come from Poland and moved to Sweden in 2016. I am a certified graphic designer, but I have developed a strong interest in coding.<br>
      I believe programming is a fantastic way to practice logical thinking and analytical skills, which I absolutely love.
